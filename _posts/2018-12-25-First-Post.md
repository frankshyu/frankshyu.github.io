Dear friends, after procrastinating for two years, I have finally made up my mind to start a blog. As someone who spent most of his childhood in Taiwan, this blog serves as memo to share my findings about everything different between the East Asian island and the fascinating Silicon Valley. In addition to that, I might share some random interests that might or might not be relevant to the topics above.

For now, I can think of three categories into which the posts will fall: *tech industry*, *investment and business*, and *history*. I would love to post more about technical learnings, possibly things related to distributed system and machine learning, from my career with Twitter, but being still a newbie, I will have to learn more in order to contribute something meaningful. 

The first category is, no doubt, *tech industry*, the magical ingredient that drives the incredible growth of the Valley. Fifty years after Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce founded *Intel*, the "tech corridor," a belt surrounding Highway 101 from San Francisco to San Jose, still shines as the strongest growing engine in the gloabl economy. For decades, people tried hard to find a secret formula for the success of the Valley. Under this category, I will discuss tech titans, interesting startups, and venture capital funds that together forged the unique culture of the Silicon Valley.

The second category is somewhat irrelevant to my profession: *investment and business*, which is enlightened by the great podcast *Masters in Business* by Barry Ritholtz (@ritholtz on Twitter). Under this category, I will share learnings in the vast world of investment and business, mostly from the abovementioned podcast.

Last but not least, I will share something purely of my interest, history. Focusing mainly on the Second World War and Medieval Eurpoe, different aspects of the history will be revealed and shared. 

For friends who already know me, hopefully this blog serves as a nice topic for conversations when we grab a beer next time. For new friends who randomly visited this site, hope you enjoy!
